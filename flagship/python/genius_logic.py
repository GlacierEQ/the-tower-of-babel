"""Genius Logic --- deductive reasoning engine with contradiction hunting and an adversary.

Vendored from the APEX `longest-horizon` framework (``.agents/longest-horizon/framework/genius_logic.py``)
so the Tower flagship remains self-contained and portable. Pure standard library only.

Symbolic reasoning over a belief set:
  * modus-ponens fixpoint propagation through declared implication rules;
  * contradiction detection between propositions that point at each other;
  * an adversary simulator that tries to falsify a claim using contradicting
    evidence, returning a refutation verdict instead of a vibe.

Provenance: once a proposition is established true its truth is immutable here,
and contradictions are surfaced (never silently merged) so the operator decides.
