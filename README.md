# The Tower of Babel

> **An executable technology-selection, interoperability, and proof system for multi-language engineering.**

[![Spiral Engine](https://github.com/GlacierEQ/the-tower-of-babel/actions/workflows/spiral.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/GlacierEQ/the-tower-of-babel/actions/workflows/spiral.yml)

The Tower of Babel **decides where a technology belongs, explains why it belongs there, shows how it works, verifies the claim at the strongest available proof level, and exports the result for humans, software, and AI agents**.

It is not a language collection built for display. It is a governed engineering map: **35 technology floors**, **70 linked exhibits**, versioned interface contracts, explicit blockers, executable build gates, and deterministic receipts. A floor earns its role through runtime behavior, safety, performance, hardware fit, or interoperability—not decorative polyglot signaling.

## The system in one minute

| Capability | What the Tower does |
|---|---|
| **Technology placement** | Records the What, Where, When, Why, and How for every admitted language, format, compiler layer, HDL, and proof system. |
| **Executable learning path** | Pairs each floor with an approachable exhibit and a substantive advanced implementation. |
| **Truthful verification** | Compiles, tests, benchmarks, integrates, or formally verifies a claim; unavailable dependencies return exact blockers instead of false success. |
| **Cross-language composition** | Publishes versioned interfaces so components cooperate without duplicating responsibility. |
| **Agent-readable authority** | Generates contracts for Megamind, Spiral Engine, Smithery publication metadata, build orchestration, maturity, and integration planning. |
| **Deterministic evidence** | Seals governed files and emits reproducible proof and release receipts. |

| Governed surface | Count |
|---|---:|
| Technology floors | **35** |
| Easy + advanced exhibits | **70** |
| Behavioral proof floors | **14** |
| Formal proof floors | **3** |
| Explicitly gated floors | **10** |

A recruiter can see what the system accomplishes. An engineer can inspect execution and failure semantics. An agent initializes from the same canonical contracts without inventing a competing architecture.

## Inside the engine

`registry/tower.yml` is the root authority. It indexes governed `registry/tower.d/*.json` technology fragments and `registry/advanced-claim-contracts.json`; the README, Atlas, and every machine-readable projection are derived from that combined authority.

### The engineering contract

A technology is admitted only when the registry establishes:

- its unique responsibility and architectural boundary;
- its activation conditions and the reason another floor should not own the work;
- an easy exhibit and an advanced exhibit;
- a pinned toolchain reference, build/test commands, and execution tier;
- hardware, service, and toolchain constraints;
- cross-language interfaces and owning Megamind agents/pistons;
- an evidence state and proof class matching checked-in verification;
- a registry-owned semantic claim contract with source assertions, failure cases, receipt fields, and prohibited overclaims.

Working components are extended rather than rewritten for novelty. A new language must provide measurable value at a clear boundary without duplicating a component that already works.

### Flagship polyglot mission

```text

    → ProtoJSON mission contract

    → capability plan
Rust authority governor

Go telemetry emitter
    → execution event
SQL canonical state

```

See [`flagship/README.md`](flagship/README.md) and run `python flagship/run_pipeline.py`.

### Proof before promotion

| Evidence state | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `illustrative` | Teaches syntax or the central concept; no stronger runtime claim is made. |
| `compiles` | A pinned compiler or schema tool accepts the exhibit. |
| `tested` | Automated behavioral checks pass. |
| `benchmark` | A reproducible performance measurement exists. |
| `hardware_gated` | The implementation is present but requires declared hardware. |
| `toolchain_gated` | The implementation is present but its compiler is absent from portable CI. |
| `service_gated` | A declared external service is required. |
| `formally_verified` | A proof kernel accepts the theorem. |
| `integrated` | The floor participates in the flagship multi-language system. |
| `production_reference` | Operational failure handling, observability, and deployment evidence exist. |

## Advanced Exhibit Atlas

The easy exhibit teaches the technology. The advanced exhibit must own a real engineering boundary, expose failure behavior, and terminate in proof or an exact blocker. [`ADVANCED_EXHIBITS.md`](ADVANCED_EXHIBITS.md) publishes the signature engineering move and claim boundary for all 35 floors; [`quality/advanced_exhibit_atlas.json`](quality/advanced_exhibit_atlas.json) provides the same map to agents and automation.

## The thirty-floor map

The matrix is generated from the canonical registry. Change the registry and exhibits—not this README—to change a floor.

## Machine entrypoint

An AI system should treat the Tower as an authority service, not prose to imitate.

1. **Initialize** from `registry/tower.yml` or the generated Megamind map.
2. **Resolve** a mission into capabilities and interfaces.
3. **Select** floors whose activation conditions and proof class satisfy the mission.
4. **Reject** duplicated ownership, missing evidence, and undeclared interfaces.
5. **Execute** through generated build contracts or governed adapters.
6. **Preserve** blockers, hashes, proof state, and receipts downstream.
7. **Promote** capability only through an explicit admission or evidence update.

### Portfolio mesh

The Tower owns technology placement and proof. Connected repositories retain their own operational authority and consume Tower exports rather than maintaining competing registries.

| Repository | Relationship | Boundary |
|---|---|---|
| [`GlacierEQ/AKOS`](https://github.com/GlacierEQ/AKOS) | Governance and agent-orchestration authority | Canonical governance, evidence, completion, and operating-sequence contract. |
| [`GlacierEQ/aspen-grove-core`](https://github.com/GlacierEQ/aspen-grove-core) | Memory and context-continuity peer | Preserves durable context and continuity without competing with Tower placement authority. |
| [`GlacierEQ/apex-boot-core`](https://github.com/GlacierEQ/apex-boot-core) | Identity and initialization peer | Activates identity, capability, and initialization contracts before governed execution. |
| [`GlacierEQ/Pro_Code`](https://github.com/GlacierEQ/Pro_Code) | Engineering doctrine peer | Publishes standards, doctrine, and playbooks consumed by implementation systems. |
| [`GlacierEQ/pro-code`](https://github.com/GlacierEQ/pro-code) | Governed engineering-execution peer | Executes, verifies, cures, and persists engineering changes under shared governance. |
| [`GlacierEQ/job-app-helix`](https://github.com/GlacierEQ/job-app-helix) | Portfolio projection and evidence mesh | Presents capability and proof without becoming the technology authority. |
| [`GlacierEQ/apex-control-plane`](https://github.com/GlacierEQ/apex-control-plane) | Control-plane peer | Execution and automation surface that can consume governed selections. |
| [`GlacierEQ/apex-cli`](https://github.com/GlacierEQ/apex-cli) | Operator-facing peer | Command surface for downstream control-plane workflows. |
| [`flagship/`](flagship/) | In-repository integration proof | Executes the strict polyglot mission contract. |

External links describe curated portfolio relationships, not a claim that every repository is live-synchronized. Generated interfaces and ownership maps remain the machine-checkable integration source.

## Governance that survives automation

- `main` is the living worker; completed functionality lands there.
- Generated surfaces are never hand-edited; `tower generate --check` rejects drift.
- Every claim carries an evidence state, proof class, and registry-owned semantic claim contract.
- Blocked hardware, tools, and services remain visible and machine-readable.
- Cross-language interfaces are explicit and versioned.
- Megamind consumes Tower exports and does not maintain a competing registry.
- Smithery remains `declared-not-published` until an MCP package and external publication receipt exist.
- The Spiral runtime is executable; registry activation remains `declared` until governed promotion.
- Integrity, build evidence, proof reports, and receipts remain deterministic review surfaces; `main` receipts additionally receive OIDC-bound Sigstore provenance.

## Truth boundary

The Tower is an **operational-alpha engineering authority**. It makes strong claims only where checked-in evidence supports them. Toolchain-, hardware-, and service-gated floors remain explicitly gated. Smithery publication is not claimed. External portfolio relationships are architectural contracts unless a repository contains and verifies a live adapter.
